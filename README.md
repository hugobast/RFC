# RFC

An RFC starts with a problem statement, followed by an exploration of useful facts about the problem, to close with  a proposal for a specific solution. RFC is about _seeking out feedback_ and leverage our collective engineering brains.

An RFC will be open for a minimum of 2 days up to a maximum of a week. There can be exceptions made to this rule.

## Contributing

This repo is equiped with an issue template to give a framework to proposals. This repo is also open for RFC proposals about itself. Once an RFC closes it will be turned into an archived markdown file and commited to source.

### Process for archiving an issue

```bash
