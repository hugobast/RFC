# RFC

An RFC starts with a problem statement, followed by an exploration of useful facts about the problem, to close with a proposal for a specific solution. RFC is about _seeking out feedback_ and leverage our collective engineering brains.

An RFC will be open for a **minimum of 2 days** up to a **maximum of a week**. *There can be exceptions made to this rule*.

## Contributing

This repo is equiped with an issue template to give a framework to proposals. This repo is also open for RFC proposals about itself. Once an RFC closes it will be turned into an archived markdown file and commited to source.

### Process for archiving an issue

```bash
archive RFC-1
```

_Taking PRs to build the above_

### But why?

Our peers have insights on the problem and the possible solutions that we as a single person don’t have. This is precious feedback we get to have before we start. Our peers will get to intimate knowledge about what’s being built by both reading the proposals and giving feedback on proposals. We as requesters are thinking clearly about the problem and doing research making for better understanding of the problem.

### This is not!

This is not meant to be time consuming, this isn't a place to blow everyone's mind about how perfect our proposals are. The proposals don't even have to be correct or even specify the best solution initially. The process of RFC will take care of building consensus and ensure we come to a satisfying solution.
